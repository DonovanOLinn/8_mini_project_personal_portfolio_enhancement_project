                        I’m a creative Brazilian-American Jew born and raised in Southern California. I use my art to build empathy through immersive and emergent storytelling & create a roadmap for healthy communications. I’m particularly interested in exploring community & destigmatize mental health conditions through genre-based multi-media.

                        I’m not a musician, but I play the funny bone and the heartstrings. As evidenced by the previous sentence, I’m incredibly corny.

                        My work blends sentiment, humor, interactivity, subversive use of genre, wordplay, & playfulness - making for unmistakably sweet, goofy, & surprising experiences. <p>My producing work in documentary films has been critically acclaimed. In recent memory, films I produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPFkcoTfr7g"><em>The Queen of Basketball</em> (2022)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xttrkgKXtZ4"><em>The Last Repair Shop</em> (2023)</a> both respectively won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). My screenplay <em>Snow Day</em> (2019) was selected for Austin Film Festival’s Script Competition - as a Second Rounder. My tabletop game <em>An Arm & A Leg</em> (2022) won the Dice Tower West Board Game Design Competition Champion and my party drawing game <em>Disasterpieces</em> is slated to come out through Skybound Entertainment in 2025.

                        I’m excited to face the challenges of integrating new programming skills into my creative works.
