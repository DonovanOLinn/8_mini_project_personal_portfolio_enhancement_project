            </header>

            I’m a creative Brazilian-Jewish-American born and raised in Southern California. I use my art to build empathy through immersive and emergent storytelling & create a roadmap for healthy communications. I’m particularly interested in exploring community & destigmatize mental health conditions through genre-based multi-media. <p>I’m not a musician, but I play the funny bone and the heartstrings. As evidenced by the previous sentence, I’m incredibly corny.</p> My work blends sentiment, humor, interactivity, subversive use of genre, wordplay, & playfulness - making for unmistakably sweet, goofy, & surprising experiences. <p>My producing work in documentary films has been critically acclaimed. In recent memory, films I produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPFkcoTfr7g"><em>The Queen of Basketball</em></a> (2022) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xttrkgKXtZ4"><em>The Last Repair Shop</em></a> (2023) both respectively won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). My screenplay <em>Snow Day</em> (2019) was selected for Austin Film Festival’s Script Competition - as a Second Rounder. My tabletop game <em>An Arm & A Leg</em> (2022) won the Dice Tower West Board Game Design Competition Champion and my party drawing game <em>Disasterpieces</em> is slated to come out through Skybound Entertainment in 2025.</p>I’m excited to face the challenges of integrating new programming skills into my creative works.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>

            Through my work, I aim to bring clarity, joy, and connectivity to people's lives every day.
